# Sos_Game
SOS is a two-player game played on a square grid. 
The game begins with an empty grid of size n x n, where n is an odd integer greater than or equal to 3. 
The two players take turns placing either an "S" or an "O" in an empty square on the grid. 
The goal of the game is to create a horizontal,vertical, or diagonal sequence of "SOS" in the grid.
Your implementation of the SOS game in Python language follows these rules and allows two players to play the game on the console. 
The game is played on a grid of size 5 x 5, and the players take turns entering the row and column numbers to place their letter on the grid. 
The game ends when one of the players creates an "SOS" sequence or the grid is completely filled without any "SOS" sequences being formed.
Your implementation includes error handling for invalid input and displays the winner of the game at the end.
Overall, your SOS game implementation provides an enjoyable and challenging experience for two players to compete against each other in a classic game.
